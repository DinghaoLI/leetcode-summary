# 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

``` 
Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

    // n = length from head to entrance
    // m = length of cycle
    // k = length of from entrance to slow 
    // m-k = the length from meeting point to the next entrance
    // slow = n + k
    // fast = qm + n + k  (q>0, number of turns)
    // fast = 2 * slow
    // => n = qm -k
    // => n = (q-1)m + (m-k)
    // so we start from slow and head, and they are moving forward at the same speedï¼ŒWhen they meet, the meeting point is the entrance of cycle
    detector := head
    for detector != slow {
        detector, slow = detector.Next, slow.Next
